# reno

This is a hacky implementation of [deno](https://github.com/ry/deno) in Rust, use at your own risk!

Uses [prost](https://github.com/danburkert/prost) for Protocol Buffers support.

# Dependencies

## Rust

Check the [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

## V8 build

See [rust-v8worker2](https://github.com/matiasinsaurralde/rust-v8worker2) for details. You will need to set the appropriate environment variables because I'm still learning `cargo`.

## Requirements

Tested on OS X.
